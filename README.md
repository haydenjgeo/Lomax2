# Lomax2
Modified version of LomaxTools (Roth, 2021) which can be found at https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/281159851 

Please cite this code as appropriate with the DOI 10.5281/zenodo.10048974

This version of LomaxTools can be used to recreate all analyses presented in Jacobson et al. (2023). This code is written entirely in Matlab.

To run all code: download the folder Lomax2 and run the script 'Run_allcode.m' from the main 'Lomax2' folder. This code calculates results for each of 3 experimental epochs and then creates several figures. Note that bootstrapped error estimates take several hours to run, so all results are included in the 'Lomax2' folder and you may recreate all figures immediately by only running the code under the 'create figures' heading in 'Run_allcode.m'. 

See comments and headers in individual scripts for more information on code operation.
